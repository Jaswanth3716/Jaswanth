/*
Assessment Requirements
1. Create a variable that can hold a number of cars. What type of variable might this be?
2. Create an object inside your addCar function that will hold the metadata for your cars. 
   The metadata values will be passed to the function as parameters. When the car is ready, 
   you will store it in the variable you created in step 1.
3. Your listCars() function will print all of your cars' metadata to the console (i.e., console.log("Model: " + someCar.model)).
4. For good measure, getTotalCars() should return the number of cars you have created.

// Create a variable to hold your cars
const carCollection = [];

// This function will take in some values as parameters, create a
// car object using the parameters passed to it for its metadata,
// and store it in the variable above.
function addCar(make, model, year, color) {
  const car = {
    make: make,
    model: model,
    year: year,
    color: color,
  };
  carCollection.push(car);
  console.log("Added Car: " + make + " " + model);
}

// Create a function that will go through an array of cars
// and print their metadata with console.log()
function listCars() {
  carCollection.forEach((car, index) => {
    console.log(\nCar #${index + 1});
    console.log("Make: " + car.make);
    console.log("Model: " + car.model);
    console.log("Year: " + car.year);
    console.log("Color: " + car.color);
  });
}

// Print the total number of cars we have added to the console
function getTotalCars() {
  console.log("\nTotal Cars Added: " + carCollection.length);
}

// Call your functions below this line
addCar("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020, "Blue");
addCar("Honda", "Civic", 2018, "Red");
listCars();
getTotalCars();
